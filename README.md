# ðŸš€ Next.js + tRPC Template

A modern, fully-typed, and batteries-included starter template for building scalable, type-safe full-stack applications with **Next.js** and **tRPC**.

---

## Description

This template provides a robust foundation to kickstart your Next.js projects with seamless end-to-end type safety using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/). Built for developers who want to maximize productivity without compromising on maintainability or developer experience.

- **Type-safe API routes** with automatic inference between frontend and backend
- Fully configured with **Next.js 15** (app/router)
- Supports **React Query** for effortless data fetching and caching
- Includes example CRUD operations, authentication setup, and error handling best practices
